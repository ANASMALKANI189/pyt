It's been a long, long wait for India and they now join West Indies and England as the only three teams to have won the Men's T20 World Cup two times. You really couldn't ask for more, what a grand finale we have had here in Barbados and both sides gave it their all! The Indian players are up in ecstasy and the playing field is flooded by the dugout. The crowd is at the top of its lungs and it's another heartbreak for South Africa, they simply couldn't get it done. Rohit Sharma is down in tears, as he was after the 2023 World Cup final - but this time, these are tears of joy. You really have to hand it to the Indian side, they were down and out but what redemption this is for the Men in Blue.")

The event has generally been held every two years. In May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, with South Africa being the possible host,[2] but the ICC later dropped the idea of a 2018 edition at the conclusion of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.[3] The 2020 edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed until 2021, with the intended host changed to India. The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was later relocated to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman[4] due to problems relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in India, taking place 5 years after the previous (2016) iteration."

After a gap of five years, India won the hosting rights of 2021 edition as well, but due to COVID-19 pandemic the matches were played in Oman and the United Arab Emirates."
